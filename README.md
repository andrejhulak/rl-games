For now just pong with RL with pygame and numpy. Later will do other games.

Nothing works yet, the network seems to be learning but then the weights explode at some point.

TODO:
1. fix learning
2. fix everything
3. fix everything again
4. understand how long it has to learn
5. change reward function
